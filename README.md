# cpic-guidelines - CPIC Guideline Documents

This repository is a collection of [CPIC](https://www.cpicpgx.org) drug dosing guideline publications and their supplemental data. 


## Organization

All guidelines are grouped into folders named for the drug or drug classification discussed. Each guideline will have an initial publication and could possibly have an *update* publication as well. Each publication is stored in a folder named for the year of publication. These folders contain the publication itself (named using the [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) identifier) and any supplemental data.


## Maintainers

This repository is maintained by the [PharmGKB](https://www.pharmgkb.org). All guidelines included here have been [annotated by the PharmGKB curation team](https://www.pharmgkb.org/view/dosing-guidelines.do?source=CPIC).
